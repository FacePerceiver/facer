# FACER

Face related toolkit. This repo is still under construction to include more models.

## Install

The easiest way to install it is using pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/FacePerceiver/facer.git@main
```
No extra setup needs, pretrained weights will be downloaded automatically.


## Face Detection

We simply wrap a retinaface detector for easy usage.
Check [this notebook](./samples/face_detect.ipynb).

## Face Parsing

We wrap the [FaRL](https://github.com/faceperceiver/farl) models for face parsing.
